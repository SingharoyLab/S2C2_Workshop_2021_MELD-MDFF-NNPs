# Running MELD from AF2 predicted structure:
AlphaFold predicted structure was used as the starting structure for the MELD simulation. We kept the region with high confidence score restrained and modelled 
rest. All the input and output files can be found here:

https://github.com/SingharoyLab/S2C2_Workshop_2021_MELD-MDFF-NNPs/tree/master/2-MELD

and CryoEM-MELD.rst file has all the instruction about how to get MELD predicted structure from the AF2 predicted structure.

# Other uses of MELD

MELD can be used in protein structure predictions from amino acid sequences, protein-peptide and protein-DNA binding as well. The followings are the tutorials showing how to do these:
